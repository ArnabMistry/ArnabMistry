### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m **Arnab**, a computer science student and software developer based in India.

I build clean, well-structured applications with a strong focus on fundamentals, UI clarity, and real-world usability.

If something feels broken, inefficient, or poorly designed, chances are I’ll try to rebuild it properly.

My main tech stack is React, Next.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy thinking deeply about frontend architecture, state management, and performance.

I’ve led development teams, organized large technical events, and built under pressure in hackathons and competitive environments.

You’ll find a mix of UI-focused projects, experiments, and real-world builds pinned here.

#### Fun Facts:

* I care a lot about clean design and structure  
* I enjoy building things from scratch  
* I like solving problems by breaking them down  
* **Hobbies:** learning, building, shipping projects
